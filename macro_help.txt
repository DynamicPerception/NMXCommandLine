runMacro syntax -- "runMacro [PATH]"
Example -> "runMacro c:\NMXmacro.txt"
The text file should have one command on each line with the following syntax:
[DELAY TIME] [COMMAND TYPE].[COMMAND NAME] [DATA or MOTOR # (if required)] [MOTOR DATA (if required)]
The following example enables the camera, sets the focus time to 600ms, trigger time to 100ms, sets home
for each of the motors (e.g. sets current position to 0), immediately takes an exposure, commands the motors to
a new position, waits 5000ms, takes another exposure, waits 1000ms, commands the motors back to their original
0 c.setEnable 1
0 m.setHome 1
0 m.sendTo 1 2560
0 m.sendTo 1 0
5000 c.expose
Lines in the macro file may be commented out by starting a line with "//"
